# MyQtProjectTemplate
This is my compilation of cookbook that I found useful, yet wanted to integrate into a single project with multiple .pri that support the ease of use through enable or disable the *.pri in *.pro file.

I try to keep things as modular and as orginal as the original author work. However, certain thing may changes to allow convenient and similiar behaviour throughout the project.

## My Add-On
### add on to rschaing.material
1. FloatingNavigationDrawer
2. SwipeRectangle

### add on to brexis.qml-bootstrap
1. None, in fact, i removed most of them only interested with the FontAwesome and the Javascript he created. :D

### add on screen dpi control
1. I seriously lost where i got the source from, with a little custom modification to ready dpi from Native Android.

### Qt example, convert into *.pri to use as use need it
1. Qt Log File Position Source as MyPosition.

## My thought
I have no intention to take the credit of other people work. This is merely a compilation of anything I found interesting. Do credit back to the original author if use any of their work copy from here.

My idea here, is just to prepare some ready made template for rapid prototyping for my future hackathon.

Thanks!
